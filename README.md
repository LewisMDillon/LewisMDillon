### Chi Sono Io 👨🏽‍🦱

A draft gallery website for a photography project of mine which has been awarded funding from Caritas Italiana. The aim is to bring public awareness of migrants in Sardinia, which was one of the main locations for disembarking migrants. I want to highlight them not as "migrants" but as people like all of us. This will be done through stories which recall common human emotions and themes, like family or celebration. Unfortunately, due to Covid restrictions, the project has been put on hold indefinitely. Hopefully it will resume next year.

An e-commerce site built with Django and PostgreSQL, featuring search, tags, ajax forms, likes, infinite scroll, sorting stock by data, user accounts, automated emails, and a fully functional payment system using Stripe.
